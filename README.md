## 🔍 Overview
- **Data preprocessing**: Handling missing values, dropping irrelevant columns.  
- **Feature engineering**: Created new features such as *FamilySize* and used One-Hot Encoding for categorical data.  
- **Modeling**: Trained and compared Logistic Regression and Random Forest.  
- **Evaluation**: Accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report.
